# CSHMM_ComputationalGenomics

# Introduction
The code listed in this repo is a final course project for CBMFW4791 computational genomics at Columbia university, taught by professor Itsik Pe'er.  The goal of this project was to use a variety of HMM architectures to predict protein secondary structure from primary structure emissions.  We first collected data from the cap7 protein structure classification competition provided by (https://www.princeton.edu/~jzthree/datasets/ICML2014/dataset_readme.txt).  


We then developed a traditional HMM architecture and verified that it predicted protein secondary structure at a level consistent with what is found in the literature.  The code to run this traditional HMM is 'traditional_hmm.ipynb'
